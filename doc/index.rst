ALARA: Analytic and Laplacian Adaptive Radioactivity Analysis
=============================================================

 The primary purpose of ALARA is to calculate the induced activation
 caused by neutron irradiation throughout a nuclear system
 (including fission reactors, fusion reactors, and accelerators).
 Some projects currently using ALARA include ARIES, IFMIF and the
 Z-Pinch Power Plant study.
