<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The primary purpose of ALARA is to calculate the induced activation<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#ia">[G]</a></font> 
    caused by neutron irradiation<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#ni">[G]</a></font> 
    throughout a nuclear system (including fission reactors, fusion reactors, 
    and accelerators). The usage of ALARA is fairly straightforward, requiring 
    little knowledge of the code's inner workings. This Users' Guide, however 
    does assume that the reader is familiar with the basic problem of induced 
    activation<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#ia">[G]</a></font>. Background 
    on induced activation, and details on ALARA's can be found in [ref. 1]. This 
    reference will also help ensure that ALARA is well-suited to the problems 
    that you are trying to solve. <br>
    This Users' Guide will describe the command-line options of ALARA, input file<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#if">[G]</a></font> 
    structure and the basic support files necessary to run ALARA. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FEATURES:</font></strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>ALARA takes full advantage of being a newly developed code by implementing 
    the best features of the previous generation of activation codes and, at the 
    same time, addressing their various weaknesses. Furthermore, an entirely new 
    set of features has been implemented and continued development will allow 
    it to respond to the evolving needs of the entire user community. ALARA's 
    three main design principles are accuracy, speed, and usability. ALARA matches 
    the previous generation of activation codes in accuracy and is much faster. 
    This is achieved by adaptively choosing the mathematical method at the smallest 
    resolution in order to optimize both speed and accuracy.</p>
  <p><strong>&gt;</strong>The following features are found individually in other 
    activation codes (primarily FISPACT, DKR and RACC): </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>&#8226;&nbsp;multi-point (3-D) solutions in a variety of geometries <br>
      &#8226; accurate solution of loops in activation trees <br>
      &#8226; exact modeling of multi-level pulsing irradiation histories<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#ih">[G]</a></font><br>
      &#8226; user-defined calculation precision/accuracy <br>
      &#8226; tracking the accumulation of light ions </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>&gt;</strong>The following features are not found in other activation 
    codes, but should be considered basic elements of any modern activation code: 
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>&#8226; straightforward, user-friendly input file creation <br>
      &#8226; full, easy-to-read activation tree output (not just pathway analysis) 
      <br>
      &#8226; flexible output options NOW including the direct calculation of 
      waste disposal rating<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#was">[G]</a></font> 
      and clearance indices<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#ci">[G]</a></font>. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>&gt;</strong>The following ADVANCED features are unique to ALARA 
    and its development history: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>&#8226; unlimited number of reaction channels <br>
      &#8226; exact modeling of hierarchical arbitrary irradiation schedules <br>
      &#8226; reverse calculation mode </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Finally, ALARA is undergoing continuous development with many new features 
    planned for implementation, both to increase the level of physical modeling, 
    the range of problems which can be solved, and its ease of use. ALARA is a 
    fully developed and validated alternative to the previous generation of activation 
    codes. <br>
