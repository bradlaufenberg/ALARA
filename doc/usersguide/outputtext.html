      arguments, various levels of output are available during the calculation. 
      The first part of the output file will contain this verbose output, including 
      confirmation of the input data and details of the cross-referencing and 
      preprocessing of the input. <br>
      <br>
      The second part of the output file shows details on the tree building process, 
      ranging from a simple list of the root isotopes being solved and statistics 
      on the size and speed of the solution, to details on the chain growth and 
      truncation<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#trun">[G]</a></font> 
      calculations (depending on the verbosity<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#ver">[G]</a></font>

      The final part of the output file<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#of">[G]</a></font>

  <p><strong><a name="typ1"></a>Table type 1 </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The first type has a row for each isotope<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#iso">[G]</a></font> 
      produced in the problem that has a non-zero response. If the constituent 
      keyword<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#key">[G]</a></font> is 
      given in the output block, there will be one table for each constituent, 
      followed by a table for the total mixture<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#mix">[G]</a></font>. 
    </p>
    <p>For the isotopic results of individual mixture constituents, all the values 
      are normalized to the volume fraction of that constituent. Therefore, the 
      table represents the results for a sample made up entirely of that constituent. 
      Put another way, the table represents the results normalized per unit volume 
      (or mass) containing only that constituent. </p>
    <p>For most results, the table containing the total isotopic results for the 
      interval, zone<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#ia">[G]</a></font>, 
      or mixture, is not normalized, and these values represent the result for 
      the mixture as described in the input, regardless of what volume fraction 
      if filled. However, for tables showing the total waste disposal rating (or 
      clearance index) of intervals, zones, or mixtures, all the values are normalized 
      by the total volume fraction of the mixture. Therefore, the table represents 
      the results for a 100% dense sample made up of the same composition as the 
      mixture. </p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p>The second type of table has a row for each point in the requested resolution, 
      giving the total response at that point. These results are normalized as 
      described in the previous paragraph (ie. only the waste disposal rating 
      results are normalized). </p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>For reverse calculations, the entire structure defined 
      above will be repeated for each target isotope. </p>

<p><strong>Description: </strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>ALARA also optionally produces a so-called tree file<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#ia">[G]</a></font> 
      to allow some rudimentary pathway analysis. The tree file contains much 
      information about the creation and truncation of the trees and chains used 
      to calculate the transmutation and activation in the problem. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Format: </strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>One tree will be created for each initial isotope. All the information 
      given for this isotope is based on the flux chosen for the truncation calculations 
      of this isotope, namely, the group-wise maximum flux across all the intervals 
      in which the initial isotope exists. An entry for an isotope in the tree 
      will look like this: </p>
    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">-(na)-&gt;h-3 - (0.00306937)</font></p>
    <p>The level of indentation indicates the rank of this isotope<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#iso">[G]</a></font> 
      in the tree. This can be best seen by viewing the whole file and noting 
      the line's relative indentation. The information given in such an entry 
      is as follows: </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>reaction type: (na)</strong> This indicates the reaction type(s). 
  </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>If multiple reactions lead to this product, the reactions will be separated 
      by commas. The information indicates the emitted particles only. Therefore, 
      in this example, the reaction is an (n,na) reaction. Generally, standard 
      symbols are used, such as 'n' for neutrons, 'a' for alpha particles, 'p','d','t' 
      for the three isotopes of hydrogen, respectively, and 'h' for helium-3. 
      For all neutron reactions, an additional '*' is used to indicate that the 
      product is in an excited isomeric state. Finally, for decay reactions the 
      symbol '*D' is used. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>product nuclide: h-3</strong> The product isotope's chemical symbol 
    and atomic number. </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>In cases where the product is in an isomeric state, this will be followed 
      by a letter (m,n,...) indicating which isomeric state. </p>

  <p><strong>truncation mode: -</strong> This single character indicates the result 
    of the truncation calculation<br>

      <p>This code indicates that only the radioactive decays of the chain will 
        be followed after this node. This arises when the production does not 
        pass the truncation tolerance test, but ensures that the result includes 
        all the radioactive products. Stable products which are descendants of 
        this node may be calculated if they themselves pass the ignore tolerance 
        test. </p>

      <p>This code indicates that the chain will be fully truncated at this node, 
        and the result will include this node. This arises when the node is a 
        stable isotope and does not pass the truncation tolerance test, but does 
        pass the ignore tolerance test. </p>

      <p>This code indicates that the chain will be fully truncated at this node 
        and will not be included in the result. This arises when the production 
        of this nuclide does not pass either the truncation or the ignore tolerance 
        test. </p>

  <p><strong>truncation production: (0.00306937) </strong></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote>
      <p>This indicates the relative production at the end<br>
        of operation of this nuclide from the initial isotope during the truncation<br>
        calculation. <br>
        As explained in the ALARA Technical Manual], this represents the total 
        production of this nuclide during the whole problem, assuming that none 
        of it is transmuted or decays further. If this production is not calculated, 
        for example, because the chain is only being followed on radioactive reactions 
        and this nuclide is stable, then this entry will be '-'. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1"><strong><a name="gs"></a>Gamma Source File</strong></font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Description: </font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The gamma source files created by ALARA currently has a very simple (if not 
    unweildy) format. This file is only created if the photon_src option is used 
    in one of the output blocks of the input file where the filename is also given. 
    The spatial resolution of this file is that specified by the output block. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Format: </font></strong></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>For each spatial region, there is a section for each isotope responsible 
    for gamma emissions<font size="-3"><a href="glossarytext.html#ge">[G]</a></font> 
    and a section for the total gamma emissions. Each of these sections has a 
    header line consisting of the isotope's identifier (chemical symbol and mass 
    number) or the keyword &quot;TOTAL&quot;, respectively. Within each section, 
    there is one block of gamma source values for each output time, that is, one 
    for shutdown and one for each cooling time. Finally, each of these blocks 
    contains the group-wise gamma source values in photons per second, arranged 
    in lines of 6 values per line. <br>
